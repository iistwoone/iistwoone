I plan to take Big Data Analysis with Spark/Scala,  Machine Learning, and Deep Learning as well.  Presently, I am a Center Assistant that has demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry. Skilled in Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQL, Tableau, SOAR, Microsoft Office Suite, and Windows 10.   My expertise includes data analysis and interpretation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.  My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful, and productive.
