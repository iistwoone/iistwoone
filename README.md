I am a current Master's of Science student in Data Science expected to graduate in May 2022.  I have finished the IBM Data Science & Data Visualization with Tableau certifications.  I plan to take Big Data Analysis with Spark/Scala,  Machine Learning, and Deep Learning as well.  

This is my github repository that I am using as a current portfolio and will use in the future as a place to hold my code for my future job.

Thanks!
